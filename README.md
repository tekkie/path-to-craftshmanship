# Path to Craftsmanship

Ideas on getting to be a software craftsman. Practical lessons.

The current repository started as an idea to put into writing the learning steps that [Georgiana](http://www.tekkie.ro/processes/the-software-craftsmanship-pyramid/) followed over her career. The notes can be consulted in a [separate file](pyramid_notes.md). Later, in a [talk on devforum.ro](https://devforum.ro/t/path-to-craftshmanship/2502) the idea of a group of contributors arised.

# General Principles

Generations
-----------

Writing this guide is done in "generations". They will not necessarily be
followed in order, sequentially, but intermingled, sometimes even like nested
loops.

First generation:

First write this documentation just as a "meta-guide", with the finished
structure (parts / chapters / sections) and short abstracts for each. Once
done, this documentation can already be used by a potential reader for guiding
his own independent research / learning process.

Second generation:

Each section is written by different authors in "mini feedback loops",
peer-reviewed on their own

Third generation:

Being written by different authors, the wording will differ. In order to
counteract this, one designated person will go through all parts / chapters
/ sections and rephrase them without changing the meaning of the text.

Fourth generation:

Reader's feedback and integration into the guide / book.


Writing Principles
------------------

The following are principles aimed at harmonizing the documentation which is
yet to be written.

- always use the right terminology
- understand how something works under the hood, but go at most 1 level deeper
  at a time
  For instance: when you learn a server-side web scripting language (Application
  Layer), you need to understand HTML first.
  When learning HTML, you need to understand HTTP first.


# Structure of Each Chapter / Section

Each chapter or section (henceforth called generally *unit of writing*, abv.
UOW) must have a certain structure.

- chapters start with an *`abstract`*
- UOW start with an *`estimated time-to-finish`*
- some UOWs start with a *`motivation`* (answering the question *why learning
  this is important?*)
- some UOWs have a subdivision `Common Pitfalls` which contains exclusively
  misunderstandings commonly observed among readers
- some UOWs have a subdivision `Frequent Questions` which contains exclusively
  questions which have been asked more than twice by readers
- most UOWs should have a subvidision `TL;DR` which is placed near the
  beginning of the subdivision and contains the main points and ideas of
  the chapters, in a dumbed down / stupid simple formulation, using abstract
  and complicated terms to shorten it's length to the minimum. The *TL;DR*
  should be written near the beginning of the chapter/section,and to be
  written last, since it's meant to be read by the people who want to know
  if they have already learned what the chapter/section tries to teach.
- most UOWs should have a subdivision `Examples, Exercises and Practice` which is
  placed near the end of each chapter/section and contains examples and
  exercises ranging from easy to difficult or *god_help_me_solve_this*,
  in order to help the reader understand how to apply the teachings in a
  real world enviroment, outside the mythical sandbox.
- each chapter ends with a `Summary`.
